				know we are ready to assist you in any way to help provide service and supplies to you.
				We can provide service contracts or repair by the call. Also we have network people if
				you need any I.T. assistance. We hope we can work together to keep your to keep your money

				Having choices on who to call is the only way to get the best service and lowest price on
				your office equipment. If you have service included in your Ikon lease, you will not have
				a choice on your service provider. They will contact you very soon. Rayco can replace
